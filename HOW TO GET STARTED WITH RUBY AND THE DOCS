Download the repo

Download Ruby version 2.2.2 from archieves (http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/rubyinstaller-2.2.2-x64.exe for 64bit machines)
During install, click 'Add to path' to allowe ruby be accessed from any command line

Download dev kit TO A PERMANENT LOCATION (not a temp directory)(http://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2-20130224-1432-sfx.exe)

Now to run the commands:

Open the command window and run:
ruby --version
This will check if Ruby is installed

Next, we must install the DevKit

cd to location of devkit and run:
	ruby dk.rb init
	ruby dk.rb install


Now, we must install the needed Gems.
In any directory, run the following commands:

gem update --system
gem install bundler

You should now be ready to go with Ruby.


In order to build the documentation you need to cd into the internal repo, and run:

bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve

This will create the documentation and serve it up on the location specified (localhost:4000/DE/ is the location at the time of writing)


From now on, you should only need the final two commands. Changes are automatically picked up by the server once you make them anyway so you should not need to restart.
