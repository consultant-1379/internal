Getting notifications from Codeship into your HipChat room is really easy. Simply head over to your project settings, switch to the **Notification** tab and fill out both the _HipChat Notification token_ and the _HipChat room name_.

You can create the required tokens on the HipChat [API Auth Tokens](https://hipchat.com/admin/api) page.

More information on our notification setup is available in our documentation at the [Notification Setup](https://codeship.com/documentation/administration/notifications/) page.
